# System-Programming-course-projects
four projects done as part of my CS studies in BGU.
The projects are:
1. Coalition Race.
2. Set Card Game.
3. World Cup Informer.
4. BGU Mart.

# 1. Coalition Race
A program that simulates the coalition race- given an election outcome with connections "rank" between every pair of parties - the program will find the best coalition that can be performed.

# practice goals
The objective of this project is to design an object-oriented system and gain
implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures, and unique
C++ properties.

# 2. Set Card Game
This program implements a version of the well known card game "Set" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game))
This version of the game supports multi-player and playing against a computer player/s.
here is an example of how the game looks like:
